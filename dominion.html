            <h2>Backstory</h2>
            <p>Dominion, a malevolent strategist with an uncanny ability to track his prey, delighted in manipulating shadows and orchestrating doom. His sinister intellect and remorseless cruelty made him a formidable force, striking fear into the hearts of even the bravest warriors. With his eerie presence and unparalleled tracking abilities, he became a harbinger of despair, leaving a trail of darkness in his wake. 
            <h2>Tactical Ability: Marked for Death</h2>
            <p> See enemies through walls for a short amount of time.
            <h2>Ultimate Ability: Finish Them</h2>
            <p>Speed up and see more enemies through walls for longer.
