            <h2>Backstory</h2>
            <p>Gatekeeper, a once-respected scholar, succumbed to the allure of dark arts, plunging into the abyss of malevolence. His thirst for power led him down a treacherous path, twisting his brilliance into a sinister force. Obsessed with dominion, he devised a wicked plot to ensnare unsuspecting souls, creating a network of portals that served as his nefarious traps. Behind his enigmatic facade lurked an evil mind, weaving a web of fear and despair that gripped the land in its icy clutches. Gatekeeper became a dreaded name, synonymous with malevolent schemes and inescapable darkness.
